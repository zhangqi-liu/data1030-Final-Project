# data1030-Final-Project

Briefly described, the dataset utilized considers work-related measures concerning
staff who leave the service, and our target of this project is to understand the overall
situation of employee attrition and distinguish the reasons behind it. Furthermore,
prediction of whether an employee will leave could then be made based on his
information.

Starting with Exploratory Data Analysis, variables with zero variance, null and
duplicate values were checked to do a preliminary data processing. At the same
time, Univariate and bivariate analysis were conducted to help us gain primary insight
of the data. We then detected high correlations to tackle the multicollinearity
problem.

Finally, our optimal model was determined based F1 score as the
metrics,  Gradien Bossting has highest F1-score (58%). We then
identified some more significant factors like monthly income, age, and overtime that
affect peopleâ€™s decision on attrition, and according to these results, a clearer picture
of the reasons behind attrition was gained, and further discussion like strategic plans
for companies were made.
